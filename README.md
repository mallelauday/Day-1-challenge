# Day-1-challenge : User profile Validation 
Problem Statement :
The challenge focus on validating user details (name,email,mobile number,age) using given rules to check the profile is valid or invalid.
validation rules:
Full Name: Minimum 2 character,first character or last character of fullname should not be spaces.
EmailId: Must contain "@" and "." and does not start with "@".
Mobile Number: Check the number contains exactly 10 digits and does not start with "0".
Age: Age should between 18 to 60(inclusive).
How the code Works:
1.The program takes user input of "Full name,email,mobile number,age".
2.String operations like checking indexing and character counting are used to validate the inputs.
3.conditional statements(if - else) are appiled to check each validation rule.
4.if all conditions are satisfied the program prints the "User Profile is Invalid" or else block will execute and prints "User Profile is Valid".
Learning outcomes:
This assignement improved understanding of string handling ,conditional statements and basic input validation techniques in python.
